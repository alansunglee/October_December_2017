Set up:
1) With you and another person, take out the jokers and shuffle the cards. Give yourself and your opponent 26 faced down cards. Place the 26 cards in front of you, so that both you and your opponent can’t see your cards.
2) Nothing beats an ace and a 2 beats nothing.
Game rules:
1) Count to 3 and then flip the top card at the same time.
2) Compare the number on the cards, if your card is higher you take both cards and put it on the bottom of your deck, but if your opponent has the higher  card he takes both cards and puts it on his desk. 
3)If both of you have the same card number, the suit doesn’t matter, you place 4 faced down card on the table then flip the next top card on the table. The one with highest card takes all the cards and puts it on the bottom of the deck.
4) If both of you get the same card value again do the same thing as step 3
5) When one of you have the whole deck you will win the game.
